# homebrew-repo

## Homebrew

Brew is a package manager for OSX made with simply Ruby scripts
its features, usage and installation instructions are [summarized on its homepage][brew].

This repository is just a collection of formulae I developed to easily install some tools.
These tools are downloaded directly from the developers websites.
To use this repository type:

`brew tap carlomt/repo`


To install prerequisites for Geant4:

`brew install cmake carlomt/repo/qt@4 xerces-c`
